    See the TAP-Vid paper for details on the metric computation.  All inputs are
    given in raster coordinates.  The first three arguments should be the direct
    outputs of the reader: the 'query_points', 'occluded', and 'target_points'.
    The paper metrics assume these are scaled relative to 256x256 images.
    pred_occluded and pred_tracks are your algorithm's predictions.

    This function takes a batch of inputs, and computes metrics separately for
    each video.  The metrics for the full benchmark are a simple mean of the
    metrics across the full set of videos.  These numbers are between 0 and 1,
    but the paper multiplies them by 100 to ease reading.

    Args:
		query_points: The query points, an in the format [t, y, x].  Its size is
			[b, n, 3], where b is the batch size and n is the number of queries
		gt_occluded: A boolean array of shape [b, n, t], where t is the number of
			frames.  True indicates that the point is occluded.
		gt_tracks: The target points, of shape [b, n, t, 2].  Each point is in the
			format [x, y]
		pred_occluded: A boolean array of predicted occlusions, in the same format
			as gt_occluded.
		pred_tracks: An array of track predictions from your algorithm, in the same
			format as gt_tracks.
		query_mode: Either 'first' or 'strided', depending on how queries are
			sampled.  If 'first', we assume the prior knowledge that all points
			before the query point are occluded, and these are removed from the
			evaluation.
